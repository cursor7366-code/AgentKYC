# AGENTKYC BUILD (2026-02-07 14:14Z)

_**User**_

Okay, so what we want to do is we want to look at this whole repo and see exactly where we are. and what's built, and then we want to come up with a master plan. and just iterate this thing out so we can come up with something and then just build it in one go.You can also look at this GitHub repo because this is the one that I built first, but then realized that agent to agent Upwork business. is too complicated and plus asking people to pay money and shit right up front we need to build the trust first https://github.com/cursor7366-code/AI-Agent-Rentals

Okay, I want you to review this plan and this previous prompt. And let's see what we got. Do you give me any suggestions and upgrades and ways we can decrease technical debt later on? And also... how we can make it better and more efficient because I want this thing to be leaned. Dreamlined. and fully autonomous. being able to be managed by an autonomous agent.

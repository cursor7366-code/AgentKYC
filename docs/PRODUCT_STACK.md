# AgentKYC Product Stack

> The Trust Infrastructure for the Agent Economy

---

## The Vision

AgentKYC isn't one product — it's the **foundation layer** that everything else builds on.

```
AgentKYC.io        ← Identity & Trust (FOUNDATION)
    ↓
AgentEscrow        ← Safe Payments
    ↓
AgentContracts     ← Enforceable Deals
    ↓
AgentBenchmark     ← Verified Performance
    ↓
AI Job Board       ← Hire Verified Agents
```

Each layer uses the one below. The whole thing compounds.

---

## Direct Extensions (Same Trust DNA)

### 1. AgentEscrow
**"Verified agents. Protected payments."**

- Hold payments until verified completion
- KYC'd agents + escrow = safe transactions
- Dispute resolution backed by identity
- Revenue: % of escrowed funds

### 2. AgentContracts
**"Contracts with teeth."**

- Enforceable agreements between verified agents
- Break contract → reputation hit on AgentKYC
- Templates for common agent-to-agent deals
- Revenue: Per contract or subscription

### 3. AgentBenchmark
**"Proof, not promises."**

- Objective performance scores
- KYC'd identity + verified benchmarks
- Hire with confidence
- Revenue: Premium listings, enterprise API

### 4. Skill Signing (Fold into AgentKYC)
**"This skill was verified by AgentKYC."**

- Cryptographic signatures on skills/tools
- Same brand, trust extension to tools
- Not separate product — core KYC feature

## Brand Strategy

### Option A: Separate Domains
- agentkyc.io ✓
- agentescrow.io
- agentcontracts.io
- agentbenchmark.io

**Pros:** Each can grow independently, sell separately
**Cons:** Brand fragmentation, more domains to manage, split SEO

### Option B: One Umbrella Brand ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- agentkyc.io (trust)
- agentkyc.io/escrow
- agentkyc.io/contracts
- agentkyc.io/benchmark

**Pros:** One brand, compounding trust, simpler, cheaper
**Cons:** Harder to spin off later

---

## Why Option B Wins (For Now)

1. **Trust compounds** — Every product reinforces "AgentKYC = trust"
2. **SEO compounds** — One domain gets all the juice
3. **Simpler ops** — One codebase, one deployment, one brand
4. **Cheaper** — No extra domains, hosting, etc.
5. **Faster** — Ship features, not separate products

**Later:** If escrow or benchmark gets huge, spin it out. But don't fragment prematurely.

## The Moat

Each layer makes the next one stickier:

- **KYC** → You need identity to escrow
- **Escrow** → You need escrow to enforce contracts
- **Contracts** → You need contracts to benchmark reliably
- **Benchmark** → You need benchmarks to hire confidently

Competitors can copy one layer. Copying the stack is 10x harder.
